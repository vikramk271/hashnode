# ⭐ **CHAPTER 1 — What is Statistics? (Comedy + Cartoon Chaos Version)**

# 🎬 **Cartoon Scene: Maximum Drama Edition**

*(Dholakpur. A loud commotion. Patlu Pandit comes running with a stack of papers taller than him.)*

**Patlu:** “Bheem! Bheem! Save me! My maths teacher is chasing me with a scale!”  
**Bheem:** “Why?”  
**Patlu:** “She asked for ‘statistics’… I brought ‘statue-sticks’ from my backyard!!”

*(Patlu reveals six wooden sticks tied together like a scarecrow.)*

**Bheem slap-face:** “Arre gadhe! She wanted **statistics**, not **sticks**!”

**Patlu:** “Ohhh… I thought she wanted to decorate the classroom.”

*(Teacher in background yelling: “PAAATLUUU!”)*  
Patlu hides behind Bheem like a baby chick.

**Bheem:** “Thik hai. Sit. Let me teach you *Dholakpur Statistics*, before teacher turns you into chutney.”

---

# 📘 **What is Statistics?**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Statistics helps us understand data… the way I understand that Patlu will ALWAYS create a new problem every morning.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Statistics = **The science of collecting, organizing & understanding numbers.**

### ✔ Ultra-Desi Definition

Statistics =  
*“Kitne laddoo khaye? Kitne bache? Kitna kharcha? Kaun pass? Kaun fail? Kaun sabse zyada jhoot bolta hai?”*

Basically… **the art of knowing things without guessing.**

---

# 🍛 **Indian Analogy : Patlu’s Appetite**

Your mother checking food:

* Takes **one spoon** of sambar
    
* Says: “Salt kam!”
    
* Entire family believes her
    

This is **Inferential Statistics**.

But when Patlu tastes food:

* Takes one spoon
    
* Eats entire bowl
    
* Says: “Umm… needs more testing.”
    

That is **NOT statistics. That is theft.**

---

# 😂 **Why We Need Statistics? (Funny Version)**

### ✔ 1. To stop Patlu from lying

**Patlu:** “I studied 5 hours!”  
Statistics: Shows he opened the book for 3 minutes.

### ✔ 2. To predict the future

Like:

* “When will Motu eat samosa again?” → Answer: ALWAYS.
    

### ✔ 3. To find patterns

* Patlu falls 11 times a day on average
    
* Bheem eats 12 laddus a day on average
    
* Chutki scolds Bheem 7 times per hour
    

### ✔ 4. To compare things

* Who runs faster?
    
* Which student is topper?
    
* Who stole Tuntun Mausi’s laddu this time? (Hint: usually Motu)
    

### ✔ 5. To make decisions

* Which bike to buy?
    
* Which stock to invest in?
    
* How many samosas to order for Patlu so he stops crying?
    

---

# 🤣 **Two Types of Statistics (Fun Version)**

## **1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics (Explaining What Already Happened)**

Like:

* “Patlu fell 17 times last week.”
    
* “Bheem ate 40 laddus in 2 days.”
    
* “Motu spent ₹512 only on samosas.”
    

## **2️⃣ Inferential Statistics (Predicting the Future)**

Like:

* “Patlu will fall at least 3 times in next hour.”
    
* “Bheem will win every fight.”
    
* “Motu will see samosa → Motu will buy samosa.”
    

This is not prediction…  
**This is TRUTH.**

---

# 📊 **Indian Real-Life Examples with Bheem & Patlu**

### 🔹 **Example 1: IPL**

“How many runs does Virat score on average?”  
Patlu: “Average? I only get average marks.”  
Bheem: “Same thing, but one is good.”

---

### 🔹 **Example 2: Zomato Delivery**

“Average delivery time in Mumbai?”  
Patlu: “Mine is always 2 minutes!”  
Bheem: “Because YOU live inside the restaurant, genius.”

---

### 🔹 **Example 3: School Data**

Who is topper?  
Who talks most?  
Who eats during class? (Patlu—caught 48 times)

---

### 🔹 **Example 4: Business**

Shopkeeper: “Why are samosa sales low?”  
Patlu: “Because Motu is dieting.”  
Motu (behind him exploding): “WHO SAID THAT?!”

---

# 📘 **Statistics Vocabulary (Fun Version)**

| Term | Dholakpur Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Data** | The marks you hide from your parents |
| **Population** | All people (like the whole India or whole class) |
| **Sample** | Just a few people (like 10 classmates) |
| **Variable** | Thing being measured (height, age, # of samosas) |
| **Observation** | One person’s data |

**Patlu:** “Observation means watching Motu eat samosa?”  
**Bheem:** “That is *trauma*, not observation.”

---

# 🔥 **Summary (Funny Version)**

✔ Statistics helps understand the world  
✔ Without it, Patlu will keep giving wild guesses  
✔ You can use it for IPL, business, exams, food, everything  
✔ It's the most powerful decision-making tool

**Patlu:** “Bheem! After this lesson, I feel intelligent!”  
**Bheem:** “Beta… statistics helps many things, but it cannot fix THAT.”

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 2 — MEAN, MEDIAN & MODE (with Maximum Cartoon Chaos)**

### 🤣🔥 **WELCOME TO CHAPTER 2 — The Funniest “Mean-Median-Mode” Class Ever Taught in India**  
Featuring **Professor Bheem** & **Patlu Pandit the Disaster Machine**

---

# 🎬 **Cartoon Opening Scene:**

*(Dholakpur School. The maths class is silent… TOO silent.)*

Patlu sneaks in, holding a giant bag of samosas.  
Suddenly—**CRAAASH!**—the bag tears open and samosas roll across the entire classroom.

**Patlu:** “OH NOOO! My 100 samosas!!”  
**Bheem:** “Wait… did you REALLY have 100?”  
**Patlu:** “Umm… maybe 20? Or 50? Or 200? I lost count.”

**Bheem facepalms:**  
“Patlu… welcome to the chapter you desperately need: **Mean, Median & Mode**.”

---

# 🧠 **WHAT ARE MEAN, MEDIAN, MODE?**

The three best friends of statistics. Like:

* **Mean** = Aamir Khan (smart, balanced, logical)
    
* **Median** = Salman Khan (center of attention)
    
* **Mode** = Govinda (repeats the same dance step again and again)

# 🥟 EXAMPLE DATA: “Patlu’s Daily Samosa Consumption”

| Day | Samosas |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | 2 |
| Tue | 10 |
| Wed | 6 |
| Thu | 10 |
| Fri | 10 |

Patlu: “These numbers are totally inaccurate! I eat MORE!”  
Bheem: “Exactly why we’re learning statistics.”

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# 1️⃣ **MEAN (Average)**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Mean is like dividing samosas equally. Except Patlu never agrees.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Mean = Add all numbers → divide by how many.

### ✔ Funny Desi Analogy

Your mom gives 10 rotis to 2 kids.  
She divides equally: 5 and 5.  
Patlu secretly steals 3 more.  
That is **not** statistics.  
That is **crime**.

### ✔ Formula

Mean = (Sum of values) / (Count of values)

### ✔ Using our samosa data

Sum = 2 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 10 = **38**  
Count = 5  
Mean = 38/5 = **7.6**

Patlu: “So I eat 7.6 samosas per day?”  
Bheem: “No. You eat 0 and Motu eats the other 7.6.”

---

### 📌 **Python Example**

```python
import numpy as np

samosas = [2, 10, 6, 10, 10]
np.mean(samosas)
```

### 📤 Output

```plaintext
7.6
```

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# 2️⃣ **MEDIAN (Middle Value)**

> **Bheem’s Quote:**  
> “Median is like Patlu in the class photo… always standing in the middle because he’s tiny.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Median = The **middle value** when data is sorted.

### ✔ Desi Analogy

Imagine 5 kids standing by height:

Shortest —&gt; Tallest  
Median is the kid in the center.  
Usually Patlu.  
Because he gets pushed to the middle.

### Step-by-step for our data:

Data sorted:  
2, **6**, 10, 10, 10  
Middle value = **6**

---

### 📌 Python Example

```python
import numpy as np
np.median([2, 10, 6, 10, 10])
```

### 📤 Output

```plaintext
6.0
```

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# 3️⃣ **MODE (Most Frequent Value)**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Mode is the value that appears the most.  
> Like how Patlu appears in the principal’s office EVERY day.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Mode = Most repeated number.

### ✔ Desi Analogy

IPL Stadium:  
Most people cheer for **Dhoni** → Dhoni is mode.

Patlu cheering for 12 players → NOT mode.

### Apply to our data

Values: 2, 6, **10**, 10, 10  
Most frequent: **10**

---

### 📌 Python Example

```python
from statistics import mode
mode([2, 10, 6, 10, 10])
```

### 📤 Output

```plaintext
10
```

---

# 🤣 **EXTREME FUNNY COMBO EXAMPLE**

**Scene:** Bheem catches Patlu eating samosas during class.  
Instead of shouting, he calculates statistics:

| Statistic | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mean | 7.6 | “Patlu you’re overeating every day.” |
| Median | 6 | “You're middle-level nuisance.” |
| Mode | 10 | “You repeatedly eat 10 samosas… EVERY DAY.” |

Patlu: “So… scientifically… I need more samosas?”  
Bheem: “Scientifically… you need **jail**.”

---

# 🧪 PRACTICE PROBLEM (with humor)

Patlu eats these many jalebis in a week:  
`[3, 7, 7, 7, 2, 1, 7]`

Find:

* Mean
    
* Median
    
* Mode
    

**Patlu whispering:** “Bheem… please don't tell my gym trainer.”  
**Bheem:** “Beta… your trainer QUIT because of you.”

---

🤣🔥 **BRACE YOURSELF — CHAPTER 3 IS HERE!**  
This is the chapter where **Patlu finally discovers why his life feels unstable**…  
Because **his Standard Deviation is too high.** 😂📉📈

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 3 — Variance & Standard Deviation**

*(Where Patlu learns why he is always shaking like a Nokia phone on vibration mode)*

---

# 🎬 **Cartoon Opening Scene: Ultimate Patlu Meltdown**

Patlu is standing on a weighing scale.  
The needle moves wildly:

50 kg… 48… 52… 49… 90 (??)  
Patlu screams:

**Patlu:** “Bheem! WHY AM I FLUCTUATING SO MUCH?!”  
**Bheem:** “Because you have HIGH standard deviation.”  
**Patlu:** “Is that dangerous? Will I explode?!”  
**Bheem:** “No… but the weighing scale might.”

---

# 📘 FIRST: WHAT IS VARIANCE?

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Variance tells you how spread out the data is…  
> like how spread out Patlu’s common sense is — very far apart.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Variance = How much values **differ from the mean**.

### ✔ Desi Analogy

Think of **chapatis** your mother makes:

* All same size → Low variance
    
* One tiny, one huge, one triangle, one map of India → **High variance**
    

Patlu’s rotis look like maps.  
So his variance is ALWAYS high.

---

# 🧮 Example Data: Patlu’s running speed (km/hr)

| Day | Speed |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | 5 |
| Tue | 6 |
| Wed | 5 |
| Thu | 7 |
| Fri | 5 |

Bheem: “This looks like normal data.”  
Patlu: “That’s because Motu didn’t chase me these days.”

---

# 🔢 Step-by-Step Variance Calculation (FUNNY MODE)

### Step 1: Find Mean

(5 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 5) / 5 = **5.6**

### Step 2: Subtract Mean

5 - 5.6 = -0.6  
6 - 5.6 = 0.4  
5 - 5.6 = -0.6  
7 - 5.6 = 1.4  
5 - 5.6 = -0.6

### Step 3: Square Differences

Because maths likes drama.

### Step 4: Find Average of those squares

That is **variance**.

We won’t do manual because Patlu fainted.  
Let’s use Python.

---

# 🐍 Python Example (Variance)

```python
import numpy as np

speeds = [5, 6, 5, 7, 5]
np.var(speeds)
```

### 📤 Output

```plaintext
0.56
```

✨ **Low variance = values close together**  
Like Bheem’s marks.

🔥 **High variance = values scattered everywhere**  
Like Patlu’s exam marks.

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# ⭐ **WHAT IS STANDARD DEVIATION?**

Patlu (scared): “Is it painful?”  
Bheem: “Only if you're allergic to maths.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Standard Deviation = The **square root** of variance.

### ✔ Desi Analogy

Variance = Chutney.  
Standard Deviation = Chutney powder after grinding it.

Or…

Variance = Patlu shouting.  
Standard Deviation = Patlu screaming—**but in HD**.

---

# 🐍 Python Example (Standard Deviation)

```python
import numpy as np

np.std(speeds)
```

### 📤 Output

```plaintext
0.748
```

Low SD means:  
➡ Patlu runs *almost the same every day*

High SD means:  
➡ Sometimes Patlu runs fast  
➡ Sometimes he runs slow  
➡ Sometimes he trips  
➡ Sometimes he flies  
➡ Sometimes he disappears entirely

---

# 😂 FULL FUNNY EXAMPLE

Let’s compare two students:

### **Student A (Bheem):**

Marks: 85, 84, 86, 83, 85  
Standard deviation: **very low**  
➡ Stable  
➡ Consistent  
➡ Mature

### **Student B (Patlu):**

Marks: 10, 95, 25, 0, 70  
Standard deviation: **VERY HIGH**  
➡ Unpredictable  
➡ Chaotic  
➡ Probably cursed

Bheem: “Your results look like earthquake readings.”  
Patlu: “Is that good?”  
Bheem: “NO.”

---

# 🍛 INDIAN EXAMPLE: ZOMATO DELIVERY TIME

Suppose delivery times:

### City A:

28, 30, 29, 31, 30  
➡ LOW SD  
➡ Consistent delivery  
➡ Happy customers

### City B:

20, 50, 10, 90, 35  
➡ HIGH SD  
➡ Sometimes fast  
➡ Sometimes your food arrives tomorrow  
➡ Sometimes before you even order

Patlu: “I once got my food two days LATE.”  
Bheem: “And you still tipped the guy.”  
Patlu: “He cried.”

---

# ✔ WHEN TO USE VARIANCE & SD?

| Situation | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Comparing two groups | See which is more consistent |
| Quality checking | Ensure products are similar |
| Finance | Check risk (high SD = risky) |
| Sports | Compare player performance stability |
| Medical data | Detect abnormalities |

---

# 🎤 MINI-QUIZ (Funny Version)

Patlu’s daily samosa consumption:  
`[2, 20, 1, 25, 3]`

Is standard deviation high or low?

Patlu: “HIGH like my BP!”  
Correct answer: **HIGH**

🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 4 — PROBABILITY (Where Patlu Thinks He Has 100% Chance of Passing… He Absolutely Does NOT)**  
Featuring **Professor Bheem** (brains) & **Patlu Pandit** (zero brains but maximum confidence)

---

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu the Overconfident**

Patlu walks into class like a Bollywood hero.

**Patlu:**  
“Today… I FEEL lucky. I have **100% chance** of getting full marks in maths!”

Bheem:  
“Patlu… you also had 100% chance of falling down the stairs yesterday.”

Patlu:  
“And I fell.”  
Bheem:  
“Exactly. That’s your real probability.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 4 — PROBABILITY (Funniest Explanation Ever)**

---

# 🤔 What is Probability?

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Probability tells you how likely something is to happen…  
> like how likely Patlu is to lose his homework — VERY.”

### ✔ Simple Definition

Probability = **Chance of an event happening**

### ✔ Desi Example

You toss a coin:

* Head = Patlu does homework
    
* Tail = He sleeps
    

Probability of homework = **0%**  
Tail = **100%**

Patlu: “That’s unfair!”  
Bheem: “Realistic.”

---

# 🎉 Probability Formula (Super Easy)

```plaintext
Probability = Favourable outcomes / Total possible outcomes
```

### Example: Rolling a dice

Chance of getting **3**:

👉 Favourable = 1  
👉 Total outcomes = 6  
👉 Probability = 1/6

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# 🍩 Funny Example: Patlu & Samosas

A plate has:

* 4 samosas
    
* 2 kachoris
    
* 4 jalebis
    

If Patlu grabs one item randomly:

### ✔ What’s the probability it’s a samosa?

Favourable = 4  
Total = 4 + 2 + 4 = 10  
Probability = **4/10 = 0.4**

Patlu:  
“So 40% chance? Good enough. I’m taking the whole plate.”  
Bheem:  
“That’s NOT how probability works!”  
Patlu:  
“That’s how **Patlu** works.”

---

# 🍬 Types of Probability (with Full Dholakpur Drama)

## 1️⃣ **Theoretical Probability**

Calculated using logic.  
Like:

* Probability that Motu will eat samosa = **1**
    
* Probability Patlu will exercise = **0**
    

## 2️⃣ **Experimental Probability**

Based on experiments.

Example:  
Patlu tosses a coin 100 times.  
It falls out the window 47 times.  
Probability of Patlu messing up = **47/100**

## 3️⃣ **Subjective Probability**

Based on intuition.

**Patlu:** “I FEEL like I will top the exam!”  
Probability = **0%**  
Confidence = **100%**  
Reality = **0**

---

# 🧃 Example: Chutki’s Juice Stall

Suppose 100 customers visit:

| Drink | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Lemonade | 40 |
| Mango Juice | 35 |
| Lassi | 25 |

Probability next customer wants:

### ✔ Lemonade = 40/100 = 0.4

### ✔ Mango Juice = 35/100 = 0.35

### ✔ Lassi = 25/100 = 0.25

Patlu:  
“My probability of free juice?”  
Chutki:  
“0%.”

---

# 🎲 Important Terms (Patlu Edition)

| Term | Funny Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Event** | Something that happens (Patlu falling) |
| **Outcome** | Result (Patlu crying) |
| **Sample Space** | All things that *could* happen |
| **Independent Events** | Patlu falling today doesn’t depend on him falling yesterday |
| **Dependent Events** | Patlu eating more depends on samosa availability |

---

🐼💥🐿️📊

# 🎯 COMBINED PROBABILITY (AND MORE PATLU CHAOS)

## 1️⃣ Independent Events

Two events don’t affect each other.

Example:  
Patlu eating samosa  
Bheem solving maths  
Both happen separately.

Formula:

```plaintext
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

---

## 2️⃣ Dependent Events

One event affects the other.

Example:  
Patlu eats all samosas → Motu gets none  
Probability Motu stays calm = **0**

---

## 3️⃣ “At Least” Probability

Probability that something happens 1 or more times.

Example:  
Chances Patlu falls *at least once* in a day = **1**

Even God confirmed this.

---

# 🧪 Python Examples

### Tossing a Coin

```python
import random

random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails'])
```

### Random Number (Dice)

```python
random.randint(1,6)
```

---

# 😂 SUPER FUNNY REAL EXAMPLE — Patlu’s Exam

Patlu studied **1 chapter** out of **10**.

Probability he gets a question he knows:

```plaintext
1/10 = 0.1 = 10%
```

Patlu:  
“So 10% chance of passing?”  
Bheem:  
“No. Because even THAT one chapter you studied upside down.”

---

# 🎤 MINI QUIZ (Funny Version)

A bag contains:

* 3 laddus
    
* 2 gulab jamuns
    
* 5 jalebis
    

1. Probability of laddu?
    
2. Probability Patlu steals something?
    
3. Probability Bheem catches him?
    

**Answers:**

1. 3/10
    
2. 100%
    
3. 100%

# 🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 5 — DISTRIBUTIONS**

###   
*(Where Patlu finally figures out why his marks form a perfect Disaster Curve)*  
Get ready for the funniest, most Indian-cartoon-style explanation of **Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Poisson, Uniform, Exponential, and more!**

---

### 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s Marks Mystery**

Patlu walks sadly with his report card.  
Bheem takes it and looks:

Marks across 6 exams:  
`[2, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]`

Bheem laughs so hard he almost dies.  
“PATLU! Your marks form the **Poisson Distribution of Pain**!”

Patlu: “Is that rare?”  
Bheem: “Yes. Rarely this terrible.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 5 — DISTRIBUTIONS**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “A distribution shows how data is spread…  
> just like Patlu’s brain — spread very thin.”

---

# 🥁 WHY DISTRIBUTIONS MATTER?

Because the world follows patterns:

* Heights follow a **Normal Distribution**
    
* Coin flips follow a **Binomial Distribution**
    
* Accidents follow **Poisson**
    
* Patlu’s marks follow **Chaotic Distribution (Unique to him)**
    

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 1️⃣ NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (Bell Curve)

# 🎬 Cartoon Scene:

Patlu is eating laddus on a weighing scale.  
Scale shows: 50, 51, 50, 49, 50, 51…

Bheem:  
“Patlu… you have **Normal Distribution** weight.”

Patlu:  
“Normal? So I’m normal?”  
Bheem:  
“No. The *distribution* is normal. You are not.”

---

# ✔ Simple Definition

Most values are around the **center**.  
Very few are extreme.

Like:

* Most students score around 70
    
* Few score 100
    
* Patlu scores 2
    

---

# ✔ Real-Life Indian Examples

* Heights in a class
    
* Sugar level
    
* Daily temperature
    
* Cost of pani puri per plate
    

---

# 📉 Bell Curve Example

(Mean = 50, SD = 1)

```plaintext
49  50  50  51  50  49  50  51  50
           🔔
```

Patlu: “This graph looks like Motu’s stomach.”  
Bheem: “That’s why it’s called a **bell curve**.”

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.normal(50, 10, 500)
sns.histplot(data, kde=True)
plt.show()
```

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 2️⃣ BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION

# 🎬 Cartoon Scene:

Patlu tosses a coin.  
It hits him on the head 10 times.

Patlu: “What are the chances?!”  
Bheem: “Binomial distribution.”

---

# ✔ Simple Definition

Tests with **two outcomes**: success or failure.

Like:

* Pass or fail
    
* Heads or tails
    
* Patlu falls or Patlu falls (always fail)
    

It follows:

```plaintext
n trials
p probability of success
```

---

# 🍛 Desi Example: Samosa Shop

“What is the chance that 3 out of 5 customers buy samosas?”

Very high in India.

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python
from numpy.random import binomial
binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=10)
```

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 3️⃣ POISSON DISTRIBUTION

*(The Disaster Curve)*

# 🎬 Cartoon Scene:

Patlu counts how many times he falls per day:

Mon: 3  
Tue: 4  
Wed: 2  
Thu: 5  
Fri: 3

Patlu: “Why do I fall so much?”  
Bheem: “Poisson distribution.”

Patlu: “Is it dangerous?”  
Bheem: “Only for your bones.”

---

# ✔ Simple Definition

Counts how often something happens in fixed time.

Examples in India:

* Autos honking per minute
    
* Zomato orders per hour
    
* Patlu accidents per day
    

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python
from numpy.random import poisson
poisson(lam=3, size=10)
```

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 4️⃣ UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION

*(Everything Equal — Not Like Exam Marks)*

# 🎬 Cartoon Scene:

Patlu distributes 10 laddus among kids *equally*.  
Everyone gets 2.

Bheem: “Wait… why are YOU eating 3?”  
Patlu: “Oops… uniform distribution failed.”

---

# ✔ Simple Definition

Every value has **equal chance**.

Examples:

* Choosing a random seat in an empty bus
    
* Picking a number between 1 and 10
    
* Result of spinning a fair wheel
    

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python
from numpy.random import uniform
uniform(0, 10, 5)
```

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 5️⃣ EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION

*(Time Between Events)*

# 🎬 Cartoon Scene:

Time between Patlu’s falls:

1st fall → 5 mins  
2nd fall → 2 mins  
3rd fall → 8 mins

Bheem:  
“You follow exponential distribution.”  
Patlu:  
“So I’m exponential genius?”  
Bheem:  
“No. Exponentially clumsy.”

---

# ✔ Examples

* Time between earthquakes
    
* Time between Zomato orders
    
* Time between Motu seeing a samosa
    

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python

# 🎤 FUN QUIZ (Patlu Edition)

1️⃣ Patlu falls 4 times/day on avg.  
What distribution?  
✔ Poisson

2️⃣ Teacher randomly chooses a student to answer a question.  
What distribution?  
✔ Uniform (but Patlu still gets chosen)

3️⃣ Time between samosa cravings for Motu?  
✔ Exponential (very short gap)

4️⃣ Patlu’s marks?  
✔ Binomial fail mode

# 🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 6 — HYPOTHESIS TESTING**  

### *(Where Patlu officially tries to prove he is smart… and statistics DESTROYS him.)*

### Get ready for T-tests, p-values, Z-tests, critical values, confidence intervals — all explained in **Indian cartoon comedy style**.

---

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu vs. Science**

Patlu storms into Bheem’s house with a fake beard and a lab coat.

**Patlu:** “From today… call me *Dr. Patlu*, the genius!”  
**Bheem:** “Genius?”  
**Patlu:** “Yes! I want to scientifically prove that I’m smart.”  
**Bheem:** “You’ll need a miracle, not statistics.”

Patlu opens a giant book called:  
**“How to Look Intelligent Without Being Intelligent”**

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 6 — Hypothesis Testing**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Hypothesis testing helps check if something is true…  
> like testing if Patlu’s brain is working (spoiler: NO).”

---

# 🧪 What is a Hypothesis?

A **claim** or **assumption** about a population.

### ✔ Example

Patlu claims:  
“**I am above-average intelligent.**”

This is NOT a hypothesis.  
This is a *comedy show*.

---

# ⭐ Two Types of Hypotheses (Very Funny Version)

## 1️⃣ **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

> “Nothing special is happening.”

Like:

* H₀: Patlu is *not* smart.
    
* H₀: Bheem eats normal number of laddus.
    
* H₀: Motu doesn’t think about samosas 24/7.
    

## 2️⃣ **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**

> “Something IS happening!”

Examples:

* H₁: Patlu is smart. *(Highly unlikely)*
    
* H₁: Bheem eats too many laddus. *(True)*
    
* H₁: Motu dreams of samosas. *(100% true)*
    

---

# 🧨 What Are We Actually Doing?

We test whether H₀ is likely or unlikely.

If H₀ is VERY unlikely → we reject it.  
If H₀ is normal → we keep it.

Patlu: “So can I reject the claim that I’m dumb?”  
Bheem: “Statistics can’t change reality.”

---

# 🧮 The p-value Explained with Indian Humor

> **p-value** = “How shocking is your data *IF H₀ is true*?”

Low p-value = *“OMG impossible!”*  
High p-value = *“Normal… boring… usual Patlu behavior.”*

### ✔ Interpretation (Fun Version)

| p-value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **&lt; 0.05** | Reject H₀ → Something fishy → Like Patlu scoring 100 |
| **\&gt; 0.05** | Accept H₀ → All normal → Patlu still failing |

---

# 🧪 Example: Patlu Tries to Prove He Is Smart

Patlu took an IQ test.  
Average IQ in India = **100**  
Patlu’s score = **60**  
Sample size = 1 (lol)

His hypothesis:

* H₀: Patlu is average
    
* H₁: Patlu is below average
    

p-value ≈ **0**

**Bheem:** “Reject H₀. You are officially… Patlu.”  
**Patlu:** “Why is maths bullying me??”

---

# 🧪 Types of Tests (with Bheem-Patlu Logic)

---

# 1️⃣ **Z-Test**

Used when:

* Sample size is big
    
* Population SD known
    

### Example:

Testing if average height in Dholakpur = 150 cm.

Patlu: “Can it test my height?”  
Bheem: “Z-test doesn’t measure attitudes.”

---

# 2️⃣ **T-Test**

For small samples.

### FUN EXAMPLE

Chutki gives 5 laddus to 5 kids.  
Patlu eats 4.  
Test if Patlu’s consumption is significantly higher.

This test will say:  
**YES. He is the problem.**

---

# 3️⃣ **Chi-Square Test**

Used for **categorical** data.

### Example

Does Motu prefer samosa or tea?

| Item | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Samosa | 98 |
| Tea | 2 |

Chi-square result:  
**Samosa is statistically LOVED.**

Patlu: “I got the same result in my heart.”

---

# 🔥 CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (Fun Version)

> “How confident are you in your estimate?”

### Example:

Patlu’s height = 120 cm  
95% CI = (118, 122)

Bheem: “Means you’re between 118 and 122.”  
Patlu: “So maybe I’m 180?”  
Bheem: “NO!!”

---

# 🧪 REAL FUNNY EXAMPLE — Samosa Shop

Motu claims:

> “On average, I only eat **5 samosas** a day.”

Bheem runs a test:

Sample of 7 days:  
`[10, 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 13]`

Seems…  
Suspicious.

H₀: Motu eats 5  
H₁: Motu eats more than 5

p-value ≈ **0**

**Conclusion:**  
Reject H₀.  
Motu is a samosa-powered engine.

---

# 🐍 Python Example (T-test)

```python
from scipy import stats

data = [10, 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 13]
stats.ttest_1samp(data, 5)
```

---

# 🎤 Funny Quick Quiz

1️⃣ Patlu claims he can run faster than Bheem.  
What is H₀?  
✔ Patlu is NOT faster.

2️⃣ p-value = 0.001  
Reject or accept H₀?  
✔ Reject (miracle happened)

3️⃣ p-value = 0.7  
What does it mean?  
✔ Everything is normal → Patlu is still Patlu.

---

# 🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 7 — CORRELATION & REGRESSION**

###   
*(Where Patlu heroically attempts to prove that eating more samosas increases his intelligence… and Bheem scientifically DESTROYS that theory.)*

### This chapter is full-on Indian cartoon chaos + Bollywood-level drama. Let’s begin!

---

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s Scientific Discovery**

Patlu runs to Bheem with a chart in hand.

**Patlu:** “Bheem! BREAKING NEWS! My intelligence increases when I eat samosas!”  
**Bheem:** “How??”  
**Patlu:** “See… I ate 2 samosas → scored 2 marks.  
I ate 5 samosas → scored 5 marks.”  
**Bheem:** “That’s because you used samosas to COUNT, idiot.”

Patlu proudly:  
“I call it the *Samosa Intelligence Theory*.”

Bheem sighs:  
“It’s time to teach you **Correlation & Regression**, before the nation loses hope.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 7 — Correlation & Regression**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Correlation shows relationships…  
> Regression predicts them…  
> And Patlu misinterprets both.”

---

# 🧠 WHAT IS CORRELATION?

Correlation = **How strongly two things move together**  
(Does one increase when the other increases?)

### ✔ Types

* **Positive correlation** → both increase
    
* **Negative correlation** → one goes up, other goes down
    
* **Zero correlation** → no relation
    

### ✔ Funny Indian Examples

**Positive Correlation:**

* More samosas Motu eats → more plates break
    
* More homework → more Patlu cries
    

**Negative Correlation:**

* More Patlu studies → less he understands
    
* More Bheem scolds → less Patlu talks
    

**Zero Correlation:**

* Patlu’s age ↔ his intelligence
    
* Your height ↔ how spicy you like pani puri
    

---

# 🧮 EXAMPLE DATA (Patlu Edition)

“Hours studed” vs “Marks scored”:

| Hours | Marks |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 9 |

### ✔ Correlation calculation

🐍 Python Example:

```python
import numpy as np

hours = [0,1,2,3,4]
marks = [1,2,4,6,9]

np.corrcoef(hours, marks)[0,1]
```

Expected output ≈ **0.99**  
→ Very strong positive correlation.

Patlu proudly:  
“See! When hours increase, marks increase!”  
Bheem:  
“Yes… but YOU never increased your hours.”

---

# 🧠 WHAT IS REGRESSION?

Regression = **predicting one value based on another**  
(Like predicting marks from study hours)

> **Bheem’s wisdom:**  
> “Regression is like drawing a straight line through Patlu’s mistakes.”

### ✔ Real-Life Analogy

If you experience:

* More rain → more traffic
    
* More traffic → late to office
    
* More late → more boss shouting
    

This is a **chain regression**.

---

# 🎬 Cartoon Example: Patlu’s Speed vs. Samosas Eaten

Data:

| Samosas | Running Speed |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 10 km/hr |
| 1 | 8 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 5 | 2 |

**Bheem:**  
“Regression says: The more you eat, the slower you run.”

**Patlu:**  
“So samosas make me *heavier*?”  
**Bheem:**  
“No. They make your **soul** heavier.”

---

# 🧪 LINEAR REGRESSION (Fun Version)

Regression Line =  
**The best straight line** that fits your data.

Equation:

```plaintext
Y = mX + c
```

Where:

* Y = predicted marks
    
* X = study hours
    
* m = slope
    
* c = intercept
    

**Patlu:** “What is slope?”  
**Bheem:** “How fast Y changes with X.”  
**Patlu:** “What is intercept?”  
**Bheem:** “Where your stupidity begins (when X=0).”

---

# 🐍 Python Example: Linear Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array(hours).reshape(-1,1)
y = np.array(marks)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.coef_, model.intercept_)
```

This predicts mark for any study hour.

---

# 🤣 COMEDY EXAMPLE

Patlu enters:

“I did regression on my life data.”

Result graph:

```plaintext
More Patlu tries -> More Patlu fails
```

Regression line prediction:

```plaintext
Future Patlu = even bigger failure
```

Bheem pats his back:  
“At least the model is accurate.”

---

# 🍛 INDIAN REAL-LIFE CORRELATION EXAMPLES

### ✔ Positive

* More biryani eaten → more happiness
    
* More practice → more performance
    
* More Swiggy ads → more cravings
    

### ✔ Negative

* More petrol price → fewer long drives
    
* More shop discount → fewer items actually in stock
    
* More Maggi eaten → less hunger (temporarily)
    

### ✔ Zero

* Your adhaar number ↔ your height
    
* Number of pani puris eaten ↔ your WiFi speed
    

Patlu:  
“What about my intelligence ↔ laddus eaten?”  
Bheem:  
“Yes. Zero. Completely unrelated.”

---

# ⚡ SCATTERPLOTS (with Bheem & Patlu)

Scatterplots show correlation visually.

**Scene:** Patlu shows his scatterplot.  
Each point is where Patlu fell in school today.

Plot shows:

```plaintext
Falls increasing across the day
```

Correlation = 1.0  
Very strong relationship with gravity.

---

# 🎤 MINI QUIZ (FUN & FAST)

1️⃣ If Patlu eats more samosas and gets slower → correlation?  
✔ Negative

2️⃣ If study hours increase → marks increase?  
✔ Positive

3️⃣ If Patlu’s hat size ↔ number of cows in India?  
✔ Zero

4️⃣ If Motu eats 20 samosas → shop closes?  
✔ Perfect correlation (r = 1)

# 🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 8 — SAMPLING & POPULATION**  

### *(Where Patlu confidently uses 3 of his friends to represent ALL of India… and Bheem nearly faints.)*

### Get ready for the funniest explanation of population, sampling, types of samples, sampling bias, and more — Dholakpur style!

---

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s "National Survey" Disaster**

Patlu is standing on top of a box with a fake microphone.

**Patlu:** “BREAKING NEWS! I conducted a national survey of India!”  
Bheem: “How many people did you ask?”  
**Patlu:** “Three.”  
Bheem: “WHO?”  
**Patlu:** “Me, Motu, and Chutki.”  
Bheem collapses.  
“Patlu… that’s not a survey. That’s a *breakfast group*.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 8 — POPULATION & SAMPLING**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “If you cannot ask everyone, you ask a few wisely.  
> Not like Patlu, who only asks people who give him snacks.”

---

# 🌍 1️⃣ **POPULATION**

Population = **Everyone you care about in a study**.

Examples:

* All students in a school
    
* All pani puri lovers in India
    
* All samosa plates Motu will eat today (infinite)
    

### ✔ FUNNY EXAMPLE

Patlu wants to know:  
“How smart are people in India?”

He should check: **Entire India**  
Not just his two friends.

---

# 👥 2️⃣ **SAMPLE**

Sample = **Small part of the population** you actually study.

> **Patlu’s Sample:** himself  
> “Biased, delusional, useless.” — Bheem

---

# 🍛 Real Indian Example

Population = all biryani buyers in Hyderabad  
Sample = 200 random buyers from 10 restaurants

Patlu’s sample = people standing nearest to him  
(He’s lazy.)

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# ⭐ TYPES OF SAMPLING (FUN & CHAOTIC)

---

# 1️⃣ **Simple Random Sampling**

Everyone has equal chance.

### Indian example:

Choosing one student from entire class by picking chits.

**Patlu:** “But my chit should be bigger.”  
**Bheem:** “That’s called bias.”

---

# 2️⃣ **Systematic Sampling**

Pick every *kth* item.

### Example:

Every 5th customer entering a mall.

Patlu: “I will pick every 1st customer.”  
Bheem: “Then you’re just stalking.”

---

# 3️⃣ **Stratified Sampling**

Divide population into groups → pick from each.

Indian example:

* 10 from Delhi
    
* 10 from Mumbai
    
* 10 from Bengaluru
    

This gives **balance**.

Patlu: “But why equal?”  
Bheem: “Because some cities have more brain cells than others.”

---

# 4️⃣ **Cluster Sampling**

Pick entire groups/clusters.

Like:

* Pick 5 random schools
    
* Survey EVERY student there
    

Patlu: “So I can survey entire samosa shops?”  
Bheem: “You just want free food.”

---

# 5️⃣ **Convenience Sampling**

(VERY BAD, Patlu loves it)

Pick whoever is easiest.

Examples:

* People standing next to Patlu
    
* People giving snacks
    
* People Patlu bribes
    

Bheem: “This gives WRONG results.”  
Patlu: “But it gives me food.”

---

# 🧪 FUNNY EXAMPLE: Survey on “Favourite Snack in India”

Patlu’s sample:

* Motu → Samosa
    
* Ghasita → Samosa
    
* Himself → Samosa
    

Conclusion:  
“100% of India loves samosas.”

Bheem:  
“GO TO JAIL.”  
“That’s *sampling bias*.”

---

# 🔥 SAMPLING BIAS — Patlu Edition

Bias = **Sample is not representative**.

Examples:

* Asking only tall people → “Everyone is tall”
    
* Asking only Patlu → “Everyone is dumb”
    
* Asking Motu → “Everyone is hungry”
    
* Asking only gym people → “India is fit” (HAHAH no)
    

---

# ⭐ SAMPLE SIZE MATTERS

Small sample → UNSAFE  
Big sample → More accurate

Patlu took 3 samples  
India has 1.4 BILLION people

Accuracy = **0%**  
Confidence = **99.99% WRONG**

---

# 🧮 SAMPLE ERROR (Fun Version)

Sample says average height = 180 cm  
Population is 165 cm  
Error = 15 cm

Bheem:  
“That’s the difference between Patlu’s imagination and reality.”

---

# 🧪 Python Example: Random Sampling

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.arange(1,101)
sample = np.random.choice(data, size=10, replace=False)
sample
```

---

# 🤣 SUPER FUN EXAMPLE: “Patlu’s Fitness Survey”

**Population:** All students  
**Patlu’s sample:** Only kids eating aloo paratha

Conclusion:  
“100% students prefer eating over exercising.”

Bheem:  
“That’s not a survey. That’s self-observation.”

---

# 🎤 Mini Quiz (FUNNY!)

1️⃣ If Patlu surveys only his friends, what sampling is this?  
✔ Convenience Sampling

2️⃣ If teacher picks every 3rd student?  
✔ Systematic

3️⃣ If Patlu picks only people offering him snacks?  
✔ Corruption

4️⃣ If survey includes all classes in a school?  
✔ Cluster or stratified

5️⃣ Population = 1000, sample = 10  
Is sample too small?  
✔ YES (unless you're Patlu, who thinks 3 people represent India)

---

# 🤣🔥 **CHAPTER 9 — CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM**

###   
*(Where Patlu learns that even if he makes many small mistakes… they combine into ONE BIG, LEGENDARY MISTAKE.)*

### This is THE most important concept in statistics — but we will explain it in the most Indian-cartoon, rib-cracking funny way possible.

---

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s Multiplying Mistakes**

Patlu is doing homework.

* Mistake 1: Writes “2 + 2 = 22”
    
* Mistake 2: Spells “maths” as “mats”
    
* Mistake 3: Draws a samosa instead of a triangle
    
* Mistake 4: Uses glue instead of fevicol
    
* Mistake 5: Submits the homework to the PE teacher
    

Bheem stares silently…  
Then says:

**“Patlu, this is the CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM of stupidity.  
Small mistakes → Combine → One BIG BLUNDER.”**

Patlu:  
“THANK YOU, Bheem! So I’m scientific?”  
Bheem:  
“No. You’re statistically dangerous.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 9 — THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM (CLT)**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “No matter how the population looks…  
> the *average* of many samples becomes NORMAL.”

Let’s explain with **zero maths headache** and **maximum humor**.

---

# 🧠 WHAT IS THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM?

### *Simple Version:*

Take **many random samples** from ANY population:

➡ The distribution of their **means** becomes **Normal (bell curve)**  
➡ EVEN IF the original data is weird, ugly, messy or Patlu-like

---

# 🍛 **Desi Example (Yummiest Explanation Ever)**

Population = ALL pani puri plates in India  
Some are:

* super spicy
    
* not spicy
    
* sweet
    
* killer spicy
    
* watery
    
* too crunchy
    
* zero crunchy
    

Completely RANDOM.

But…

### If you take many samples (like 40 plates each time)

And find the **average spiciness**…

➡ Their averages will form a **Bell Curve** ❤️  
➡ NOT random!

No matter how weird the population is…

**Sample MEANS become Normal.**

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# ⭐ PATLU VERSION OF CLT (MOST EXTREME EXPLANATION)

Patlu’s daily falls:

```plaintext
Monday: 2
Tuesday: 10
Wednesday: 4
Thursday: 7
Friday: 1
Saturday: 8
Sunday: 9
```

Population = **chaotic**  
Just like Patlu.

Take 30 samples of size 4:

* Mean 3 falls
    
* Mean 4 falls
    
* Mean 5 falls
    
* Mean 4.5 falls
    
* Mean 3.2 falls
    
* Mean 4.8 falls
    
* …many more…
    

Plot them:

➡ **Perfect Bell Curve!**

Bheem:  
“This proves the CLT.”

Patlu:  
“What does it prove about me?”  
Bheem:  
“That you are consistently inconsistent.”

---

# ⭐ WHY CLT IS IMPORTANT?

Because CLT allows:

✔ Hypothesis testing  
✔ Confidence intervals  
✔ Using Z-table  
✔ Predicting means  
✔ Making Patlu even more confused

---

# 🍿 Bollywood-Style Analogy

Imagine all Bollywood actors acting:

* Some overact
    
* Some underact
    
* Some scream
    
* Some forget lines
    

Population = **MESS**

But if you take average acting of 50 films…  
It becomes NORMAL.

Patlu:  
“So Bollywood follows CLT?”  
Bheem:  
“Yes. Except Salman Khan movies.”

---

# 🧮 Python Simulation Example (Patlu Edition)

```python
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

population = np.random.exponential(scale=5, size=5000)  # very skewed

sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, 40)) for _ in range(1000)]

sns.histplot(sample_means, kde=True)
plt.show()
```

➡ Even though population = exponential (WEIRD)  
➡ Sample means = **Normal**

This is CLT magic ✨

---

# 🧂 FUNNY REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES OF CLT

### 1️⃣ Restaurant Waiting Times

Individual wait times differ, but **average waiting time** becomes Normal.

### 2️⃣ Cricket Runs

Individual innings vary wildly, but average runs per series follow a Normal pattern.

### 3️⃣ Patlu’s Daily Fails

Each fail is random.  
But his **average fails per week** follow a perfect bell curve.

**Patlu:** “So I’m normally abnormal?”  
**Bheem:** “Exactly.”

---

# 🔥 CLT IN ONE LINE

“No matter how chaotic Patlu is…  
his average behavior is predictably chaotic.”

---

# 🎤 MINI QUIZ (FUN FEST)

1️⃣ Original population looks weird. What do sample means look like?  
✔ Normal

2️⃣ CLT works best when sample size ≥ ?  
✔ 30

3️⃣ Patlu falls randomly every day. Will mean falls follow CLT?  
✔ YES

4️⃣ Does CLT apply to samosa eating?  
✔ If sample size is large (Motu qualifies)

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s “Stupidity Research”**

Patlu rushes into class with a clipboard.

**Patlu:** “Bheem! I collected my stupidity scores for the week!”  
**Bheem:** “WHY?!”  
**Patlu:** “To find which day I’m the dumbest.”

Patlu gives his scores:

| Day | Stupidity Score |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | 9 |
| Tue | 10 |
| Wed | 8 |
| Thu | 9 |
| Fri | 10 |

Bheem looks, sighs deeply:

**“Patlu… we need ANOVA, not first aid.”**

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 10 — ANOVA & CHI-SQUARE**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “ANOVA compares averages.  
> Chi-square compares categories.  
> Both compare Patlu to failure.”

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# ⭐ PART 1 — ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

### 📘 SIMPLE DEFINITION

ANOVA checks if **three or more groups have different means**.

### ✔ Desi Example

Comparing:

* Hyderabad biryani
    
* Lucknow biryani
    
* Kolkata biryani
    

Is one significantly better?

(Yes → Hyderabad 🔥)  
(Equal fight → ANOVA decides)

---

# 🎬 **Patlu’s ANOVA Example**

Patlu believes:

> “My marks differ by weekdays.”

Bheem collects data:

### Maths Marks

| Day | Marks |
| --- | --- |
| Mon | 2 |
| Tue | 1 |
| Wed | 0 |
| Thu | 2 |
| Fri | 1 |

Patlu: “See! Different values!”  
Bheem:  
“We need to check if they are **statistically different**  
or if you're just consistently terrible.”

### ✔ ANOVA will check:

Are ALL days equally bad?  
OR  
Is one day **extra** bad?

---

# 🍛 Desi Analogy

Your mom makes chai:

* Monday: strong
    
* Tuesday: light
    
* Wednesday: perfect
    
* Thursday: kadak
    
* Friday: watery
    

ANOVA will tell whether "chai quality" truly differs or it's just "your mood swings".

# 🧪 Python Example: One-Way ANOVA

```python
from scipy.stats import f_oneway

mon = [2,3,2,3]
tue = [4,5,4,4]
wed = [6,7,7,6]

f_oneway(mon, tue, wed)
```

### Output Interpretation:

* **p &lt; 0.05** → Groups DIFFER
    
* **p &gt; 0.05** → Groups SAME
    

---

# 🤣 **PATLU RESULT**

After ANOVA:

**p = 0.98**  
Meaning:  
“All days equally dumb.”

Patlu:  
“So I’m consistently stupid?”  
Bheem:  
“Yes. A stable legend.”

Example:

* Patlu’s marks
    
* Across subjects
    
* Across days
    

### 3️⃣ **Repeated Measures ANOVA**

Same person tested multiple times  
Example:  
Testing Patlu’s brain 5 times a day (all results = ERROR)

| Samosa | 50 |
| Kachori | 30 |
| Jalebi | 20 |

Are these preferences RANDOM  
or do people truly LOVE samosa?

Chi-square says:  
“Yes. Samosa is statistically unstoppable.”

# 🎬 Patlu’s Chi-Square Example

Patlu claims:

> “Students who wear red shirts are smarter.”

Bheem checks:

| Shirt Color | Smart | Not Smart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red | 1 | 50 |
| Blue | 20 | 10 |
| Green | 10 | 5 |

Chi-square result:

p ≈ 0  
→ Shirt color DOES matter  
→ Red shirts are worn by academically cursed students  
→ So Patlu fits perfectly

---

# 🧪 Python Example

```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

table = [
    [1, 50],
    [20, 10],
    [10, 5]
]

chi2_contingency(table)
```

### Interpretation:

* **p &lt; 0.05** → Categories related
    
* **p &gt; 0.05** → No relation
    

---

# 🔥 REAL FUNNY EXAMPLE

Patlu tries to prove:

> “People who eat samosas daily are happier.”

Data:

| Eats Samosa | Happy | Sad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | 98 | 2 |
| No | 5 | 25 |

Chi-square result:

**p ≈ 0**  
Conclusion:  
“YES. Samosa = Happiness.”  
Scientifically proven.

Patlu:  
“I always knew.”  
Bheem:  
“You feel same about jalebi, laddus, idli, pav bhaji…”

# 🎬 **Opening Cartoon Scene: Patlu’s “Daily Stupidity Diary”**

Patlu arrives holding a notebook thicker than a telephone directory.

**Bheem:** “What’s that?”  
**Patlu:** “My ‘Daily Stupidity Log’… I record every mistake I make.”  
Bheem flips through:

* Page 1: “Fell down stairs”
    
* Page 7: “Swallowed pen cap”
    
* Page 48: “Mistook Fevicol for toothpaste”
    
* Page 99: “Walked into a tree while waving at a dog”
    
* Page 150: “Did nothing wrong today… suspicious.”
    

Bheem:  
“This is the perfect dataset for **Time Series Analysis**.”

Patlu:  
“Does that mean I'm finally useful?!”  
Bheem:  
“Yes. As a *warning signal*.”

---

# ⭐ **CHAPTER 11 — TIME SERIES**

> **Bheem’s Wisdom:**  
> “Time series tracks values over time… like Patlu’s mistakes increasing every month.”

---

# 🧠 WHAT IS A TIME SERIES?

A time series is **data collected over time**.

Examples:

* Temperature per day
    
* Stock market prices
    
* IPL player scores
    
* Number of times Patlu gets scolded per week
    
* Auto honks per minute in Mumbai
    

Time is the key.

---

# 📈 COMPONENTS OF TIME SERIES (Patlu Edition)

We break time series into:

1️⃣ **TREND** — Long-term direction  
2️⃣ **SEASONALITY** — Patterns repeating over time  
3️⃣ **NOISE** — Random chaos  
4️⃣ **CYCLE** — Up and down long-term patterns

Let’s use Patlu’s daily stupidity data to explain.

---

# 🐼💥🐿️📊

# 1️⃣ **TREND (UPWARD/DOWNWARD Movement)**

### Example: Patlu’s Dumbness Trend

Plot:

```plaintext
Month 1: 20 mistakes  
Month 2: 23  
Month 3: 25  
Month 4: 28  
Month 5: 32 (with bonus stupidity)
```

Bheem:  
“This is a strong *upward trend*.”  
Patlu:  
“So I’m improving?”  
Bheem:  
“No. Increasing.”

Trend = Long-term movement.

---

# 2️⃣ **SEASONALITY (Repeating Patterns)**

Patlu makes MORE mistakes:

* Monday (sleepiness)
    
* Friday (happiness)
    
* After lunch (sleep induced)
    
* Rainy season (slippery roads)
    

Pattern repeats → SEASONALITY.

---

# 3️⃣ **NOISE (Random Chaos)**

Examples:

* Patlu suddenly falling into a well
    
* Accidentally starting a fire
    
* Locking himself outside the house
    
* Calling wrong number 15 times
    

Noise = unpredictable madness.

---

# 4️⃣ **CYCLE**

Like economic ups and downs.

Patlu’s cycle:

* Good week
    
* Disaster week
    
* Confusion week
    
* Emotional damage week
    

Repeats yearly.

---

# ⭐ Example Dataset: Patlu’s Monthly Mistakes

| Month | Mistakes |
| --- | --- |
| Jan | 20 |
| Feb | 22 |
| Mar | 25 |
| Apr | 28 |
| May | 35 |
| Jun | 32 |

CLEAR TREND: Upward  
CLEAR SEASONALITY: Summer = maximum chaos

---

# 🎯 MOVING AVERAGE (Smoothening Curve)

> “Take average of last few values”  
> Reduces noise.

### Patlu Analogy:

Instead of counting *every* mistake daily,  
count the average of last 7 days.

Graph looks smoother (unlike Patlu’s brain).

---

🐍 Python Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [20,22,25,28,35,32]
ts = pd.Series(data)
ts.rolling(window=3).mean()
```

---

# 📉 FORECASTING (Predicting Future)

Predict next month’s mistakes:

Given increasing trend:

Jan: 20  
Feb: 22  
Mar: 25  
Apr: 28  
May: 35  
Jun: 32

Forecast for July using simple techniques:  
➡ Around **34–38** mistakes

Patlu:  
“So my future is predictable?”  
Bheem:  
“Yes. Predictably disastrous.”

---

# ⭐ METHODS OF FORECASTING

## 1️⃣ Naïve Forecast

Tomorrow = today’s value

Patlu’s stupidity today = 5  
Tomorrow = 5 (minimum)

## 2️⃣ Moving Average

Average of last few days  
Patlu doesn’t know how to average so he fails here.

## 3️⃣ Exponential Smoothing

Assign more weight to recent values.

Recent mistakes &gt; old mistakes.

## 4️⃣ ARIMA

Advanced method  
Predicts based on:

* Autocorrelation
    
* Seasonality
    
* Trend
    

Patlu:  
“ARIMA = Arey! I’m Amazing?”  
Bheem:  
“No. ARIMA predicts how many times you’ll fall tomorrow.”

---

# ⭐ AUTOCORRELATION (Patlu’s Favorite)

Autocorrelation =  
“How related today’s value is with previous value.”

Example:  
Patlu’s stupidity today is HIGH →  
Tomorrow also HIGH →  
Autocorrelation = 0.99

Patlu happily:  
“So I’m consistent!”  
Bheem:  
“In failure, yes.”

---

# 🐍 Python Example: Autocorrelation

```python
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf
plot_acf(ts)
```

This graph shows if past values explain future ones.

For Patlu, autocorrelation = ALWAYS HIGH.

---

# 🤣 TIME SERIES REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES (Indian Edition)

### ✔ IPL Runs

Plot player runs across matches.

### ✔ Stock Market

Nifty daily closing prices.

### ✔ Daily Temperatures

India’s summer = fireball.

### ✔ Patlu’s monthly injuries

Graph peaks during rainy season.

### ✔ Zomato order frequency

Weekends = absolute madness.
